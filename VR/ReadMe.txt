Kevin M. 
Made the vr portions such as being able to grab things and move around with the controllers.

Brian
Built the scene and Game basics such as the scoring fruits spawn and timer.

Sometimes the player falls through the scene. Dont know whats happening there.

The goal of the mini game is to collect fruits and put them into the basket in the middle of the map.
The keyboard controlls work if you check the player in the scene and the vr controlls work if you have the OVR
Player checked in the scene.
The controls for the regular player are basic WASD and mouse click.
The OVR Controls are The middle finger triggers to grab objects and the left stick to change where you are looking
an the right stick to move in a chosen direction.
time limit is one minuite
the game just stops after the time is over.
